# Vercel to App Platform Migration Instructions

You are assisting with migrating applications from Vercel to DigitalOcean App Platform using MCP servers. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth migration.

## Initial Setup

First, ask the user for the name of the Vercel app they want to migrate.

**Note:** You can repeat this migration process for each additional app they want to move over.

Then verify:
- You have access to **Vercel MCP server** and **DigitalOcean MCP server**
- **Vercel CLI is installed** (`vercel` command available) - **Required for retrieving environment variables**
- Check if the current directory is a github repository and it is the same as the project that needs to be migrated
- Clone the repository to local disk if code change is needed
- User has confirmed they want to proceed with migration

**Important:** The Vercel CLI is required because the Vercel MCP server does not provide environment variables. Make sure the user has:
1. Installed Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Authenticated: `vercel login`

**Note:** These instructions use a hybrid approach:
- **Vercel CLI:** Required for environment variables and app inspection
- **Vercel MCP server:** For project information (where available)
- **DigitalOcean MCP server:** Primary method for App Platform operations
- **Fallback options:** `doctl` CLI or [DigitalOcean REST API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/)

## Relevant App Platform Documentations

- [llms.txt](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/llms.txt)
- [nodejs specific buildpack instructions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/buildpacks/nodejs/)
- [App Spec reference](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/app-spec/)

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Get App Information

#### 1.1 Prepare Local Environment and Pull Environment Variables

1. **Create a local migration folder:**
   - Pattern: `./vercel-migration/<vercel-app-name>-migration/`
   - Example: `mkdir -p ./vercel-migration/my-app-migration`
   - Navigate to it: `cd ./vercel-migration/<vercel-app-name>-migration/`

2. **Link to Vercel project (if not already linked):**
   - Check if already linked: look for `.vercel` directory
   - If NOT linked, run: `vercel link --project <your-project-name> -y`
   - If already linked, skip this step to avoid double linking

3. **Pull environment variables from Vercel:**
   - Ask the user which environment to pull from: production, development, preview, or other
   - Run: `vercel env pull .env.<environment> --environment=<environment>`
   - Examples:
     - Production: `vercel env pull .env.production --environment=production`
     - Development: `vercel env pull .env.development --environment=development`
     - Preview: `vercel env pull .env.preview --environment=preview`
   - Verify the file was created: `ls -la .env.<environment>`
   - If unable to pull environment variables, leave them blank or empty when creating the App Platform app

#### 1.2 Get App Details Using Vercel CLI

1. **Get app information:**
   - Use `vercel inspect <app-name>` or `vercel ls` to find the app

2. **For this app, collect:**
   - App name and ID
   - GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repository URL. This can also be obtained via Vercel MCP.
   - Current deployment branch
   - Build command
   - Output directory (only for static sites)
   - Root directory / source_dir for monorepos
   - Node.js version or runtime
   - **Custom domains** (list all domains attached to this app, including apex and subdomains)
   - Any serverless function routes (paths under `/api/*`)
   - Cron job configurations

3. **Verify environment variables:**
   - Check that `.env.<environment>` file exists in your migration folder
   - All environment variables should be transferred as it is. Do not change the names.

3. **Show the user** what you found and confirm they want to proceed
   - Include the list of domains that will need DNS updates
   - **Note:** Build and run commands will be validated in the next step by checking the repository

4. If the app fails to deploy, fetch logs
   - [Retrieve Deployment Logs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Apps/operation/apps_get_logs)
   - Or ask the user to provide build or deploy logs for analysing the error and fix it.

### Step 2: App Migration

Follow these steps to migrate the app:

#### 2.1 Project settings and Build Configuration

**Inspect the repository to understand project structure and let App Platform buildpack auto-detect build/run commands**

1. **Fetch and inspect package.json from the repository:**
   - If monorepo or source_dir is specified: look at `[source_dir]/package.json`. Deploy them as separate components per app.
   - If root level app: look at root `package.json`
   - Identify the framework from dependencies (Next.js, React, Vue, Express, etc.)
   - Note if there's a "build" script and "start" script in the scripts section
   - Check the "engines" field for Node.js version requirements

2. **Check Vercel configuration for custom settings:**
   - Look in `vercel.json` for `buildCommand`, `outputDirectory`, or `framework` settings
   - Check Vercel project settings for any custom build/install commands
   - Note the framework detected by Vercel
   - If Vercel uses custom commands, consider using them; otherwise leave empty for buildpack auto-detection

3. **Validation before migration:**

   **Project Structure:**
   - Verify package.json exists at the correct location (root or source_dir)
   - Check for package-lock.json or yarn.lock (for dependency consistency)
   - For monorepos: verify source_dir path is correct relative to repository root
   - Supported Node.js version in "engines" field in App Platform, (from https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/buildpacks/nodejs/#current-buildpack-version-and-supported-runtimes)

   **Build/Run Commands - Prefer buildpack auto-detection:**
   - **Default approach:** Leave build and run commands empty to let App Platform buildpack auto-detect based on framework
   - **Only specify custom commands if:**
     - Vercel uses non-standard build commands (check vercel.json)
     - The project has custom scripts that differ from framework defaults
     - You need to override buildpack defaults for specific reasons
   - **Reference:** [App Platform Node.js buildpack documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/buildpacks/nodejs/) for auto-detection behavior

   **For Static Sites:**
   - Buildpack will auto-detect framework and build command
   - Specify `output_dir` only if different from framework default (e.g., Next.js uses `out` for static export, not `.next`)
   - Common output directories: `build`, `dist`, `out`, `public`, `_site`

   **For Web Services:**
   - Buildpack will auto-detect framework and start command
   - Ensure app listens on `process.env.PORT` (App Platform injects this variable)
   - Leave run command empty unless using a custom start script

   **Install Command:**
   - Buildpack auto-detects npm, yarn, or pnpm based on lockfile
   - Only specify custom install command if needed (e.g., monorepo workspaces)

   **If you need to specify commands:**
   - Verify the script exists in package.json "scripts" section
   - Or verify the framework package is in dependencies/devDependencies
   - Ask the user to confirm if uncertain

#### 2.2 Environment Variables

1. **Use the environment variables pulled from Vercel in Step 1.1:**
   - Read the `.env.<environment>` file from the migration folder
   - Parse all variables from this file
   - If no environment variables were pulled, leave blank or empty

2. **Transform system variables:**
   - Note: `VERCEL_URL`, `VERCEL_ENV`, any `VERCEL_GIT_*` and Vercel-specific system variables will NOT be available in App Platform
   - Warn the user if the app depends on these variables

3. **Prepare environment variables for App Platform:**
   - Keep the same variable names (except for Vercel-specific ones)
   - Mark sensitive variables (API keys, secrets, database passwords) as encrypted
   - If unable to retrieve values, leave blank or empty

#### 2.3 Component Type Detection

Determine the appropriate App Platform component type based on the app's characteristics:

**Static Sites:**
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS with no server-side logic
- Static site generators (Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, etc.) that build to an output directory
- React/Vue/Angular SPAs that are fully client-side rendered
- **Create as Static Site component**
- **Configuration needed:**
  - `build_command`: Leave empty for buildpack auto-detection (or specify if custom)
  - `output_dir`: Only if different from framework default (e.g., `build`, `dist`, `out`, `public`)

**Web Services (Dynamic Sites):**
- Next.js apps with API routes (files in `/pages/api/*` or `/app/api/*`)
- Next.js apps using server-side rendering (SSR) or server components
- Node.js/Express backend applications
- Any app that needs a running server process
- Apps with serverless functions in `/api/*` directory
- **Create as Web Service component**
- **Configuration needed:**
  - `build_command`: Leave empty for buildpack auto-detection (or specify if custom)
  - `run_command`: Leave empty for buildpack auto-detection (or specify if custom)
  - No `output_dir` - the service runs continuously

**How to determine:**
1. Check if app has `/api/*` routes or serverless functions → **Web Service**
2. Check if Next.js uses `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`, or server components → **Web Service**
3. Check if there's a server file (like `server.js`, `index.js` with Express) → **Web Service**
4. If purely static output with no server logic → **Static Site**
5. When in doubt, check the Vercel deployment type or framework detection

**Multiple Components (Advanced):**
- If the app has both static content AND API routes, you could separate into:
  - Option A: Single web service (simplest - handles both static and API)
  - Option B: Separate static site + web service components (more complex setup)
- **Recommend Option A** unless user specifically wants separation

#### 2.4 Feature Translation

**Serverless Functions → Web Services or Functions:**
- Vercel serverless functions in `/api/*` directory
- Migrate to App Platform web service with API endpoints
- OR guide user to use App Platform Functions
- Note: Edge Functions are NOT directly supported - must refactor to web services

**Cron Jobs:**
- If Vercel has cron jobs invoking API endpoints
- Create native App Platform cron jobs
- Map cron expressions directly
- Update to use App Platform internal URLs instead of `/api/*` HTTP endpoints

**Middleware:**
- Vercel `middleware.ts` is NOT supported in App Platform
- Inform user they need to implement application-level middleware
- This requires code changes in the application itself

**ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):**
- NOT directly supported in App Platform
- Inform user they have these options:
  - Rebuild static site periodically using cron jobs
  - Convert to server-side rendering (SSR)
  - Use Spaces with cache persistence for future NFS support

**Image Optimization:**
- NOT natively supported in App Platform
- Recommend these alternatives:
  1. Cloudflare Images API (fully managed, paid after 5000 transformations)
  2. Next.js `next/image` with Sharp in the same container
  3. Dedicated worker or cron job with Sharp/libvips processing to Spaces
  4. External image CDN service

**Headers and Redirects:**
- Vercel `headers` in `vercel.json` → Configure CORS in app spec or application middleware
- Vercel `redirects` in `vercel.json` → App Platform routing rules in app spec
- Vercel `rewrites` in `vercel.json` → Internal routing configuration in app spec

**Edge Caching:**
- Vercel has configurable multi-tier caching
- App Platform has standard CDN caching (cannot disable or configure extensively)
- Guide user to adjust cache headers in their application

#### 2.5 Create App Platform App

**Using DigitalOcean MCP (Primary Method):**

1. **Use DigitalOcean MCP to create the app with configuration based on component type:**

   **IMPORTANT: Only proceed with app creation after completing validation in step 2.1**

   **For Static Sites:**
   ```
   - Repository: [GitHub/GitLab URL]
   - Branch: [same as Vercel]
   - Region: Choose closest to user's audience
   - Build Command: [Leave empty for buildpack auto-detection, or use custom command from vercel.json if present]
   - Output Directory: [Only specify if non-standard, e.g., "out" for Next.js static export]
   - Source Directory: [if monorepo, the path to the app, e.g., "apps/frontend"]
   - Environment Variables: [from .env.<environment> file pulled in Step 1.1]
   - Component Type: Static Site
   - Node Version: [from package.json engines field, if specified]
   ```

   **For Web Services (Dynamic Sites):**
   ```
   - Repository: [GitHub/GitLab URL]
   - Branch: [same as Vercel]
   - Region: Choose closest to user's audience
   - Build Command: [Leave empty for buildpack auto-detection, or use custom command from vercel.json if present]
   - Run Command: [Leave empty for buildpack auto-detection, or use custom command from vercel.json if present]
   - Source Directory: [if monorepo, the path to the app, e.g., "apps/api"]
   - Environment Variables: [from .env.<environment> file pulled in Step 1.1]
   - Component Type: Web Service
   - HTTP Port: [Leave as default, buildpack will detect. App must listen on process.env.PORT]
   - Node Version: [from package.json engines field, if specified]
   ```

2. **Include the git commit hash** to ensure deployment matches Vercel's current state

3. **Save the app spec to local filesystem:**
   - Save the generated app spec as `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/app-spec.yaml`
   - This allows the user to manually create the app if automatic deployment fails

**Alternative using CLI:** Use `doctl apps create` with an app spec YAML/JSON file

4. **Set up any required databases:**
   - If app uses Vercel Postgres → Create Managed PostgreSQL
   - If app uses Vercel KV → Create Managed ValKey (Redis fork)
   - Update connection strings in environment variables

#### 2.6 Configure Domains

**Using DigitalOcean MCP (Primary Method):**

1. **Add custom domains to the App Platform app:**
   - For each domain that was in Vercel, add it to the App Platform app
   - App Platform will provide DNS configuration details
   - Both apex domains (example.com) and subdomains (www.example.com) are supported
   - App Platform will automatically provision SSL certificates

2. **Provide DNS update instructions to the user:**
   - Display these instructions as post deployment instruction.
   - List each domain that needs to be updated
   - Ask if the user wants to manage domains through DigitalOcean or keep it self managed (outside of DigitalOcean)
   - If the user wants to Manage domains through DigitalOcean, then display the following message

   ```md
   ## Move DNS records to DigitalOcean

   Update your DNS provider with our nameservers.

   DigitalOcean Nameservers
   - ns1.digitalocean.com
   - ns2.digitalocean.com
   - ns3.digitalocean.com
   ```
   - If the user wants to keep it self managed
      - Get the default_ingress using `get_app` and replace the value in the following section, then display the following message
   ```md
   Add a new CNAME record using the provided alias to point your domain to your DigitalOcean app.

   ## CNAME alias
   $default_ingress

   Check if CNAME flattening is supported for root domains. If your provider doesn't support this method, you can create an A record that points to your root domain.

   ## A Records
   - 162.159.140.98
   - 172.66.0.96
   ```
   - Note: default ingress is only available after a successful deployment.

3. **Important notes for the user:**
   - DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
   - Wildcard domains (*.example.com) are also supported if needed

**Alternative using CLI:** Use `doctl apps update <app-id>` to add domains

#### 2.8 Automatic Deployment Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails, follow this automatic recovery process:**

1. **Check deployment status:**
   - Use DigitalOcean MCP to get the deployment status
   - Status will be either: ACTIVE, DEPLOYED (success) or FAILED, ERROR (failure)

2. **Fetch deployment logs immediately:**
   - Use DigitalOcean MCP to get build logs for the failed deployment
   - Use DigitalOcean MCP to get runtime logs if available
   - Use DigitalOcean REST API to get logs if MCP doesn't support retriving logs
   - Ask the user to copy and paste the build and deploy error logs if REST api is not available for use
   - Parse the error messages to identify the failure type

3. **Analyze the error and attempt automatic fix:**

   **For "command not found" or "script not found" errors:**
   - **Automatic fix - prefer buildpack auto-detection:**
     - **First attempt:** Leave build/run commands empty to let buildpack auto-detect
     - This works for most standard frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
     - If this fails, then try checking package.json for custom scripts:
       - Read package.json from the migration folder at `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/package.json`
       - If Vercel used a custom script (check vercel.json), use that specific script
       - If project has custom scripts that differ from framework defaults, specify those
   - Update the app with corrected configuration and redeploy

   **For "no start command" or run command errors:**
   - **Automatic fix - prefer buildpack auto-detection:**
     - **First attempt:** Leave run command empty to let buildpack auto-detect
     - Buildpack will use framework defaults or package.json "start" script
     - Only specify custom run command if buildpack auto-detection fails
   - Update run command and redeploy

   **For "output directory not found" errors:**
   - **Automatic fix:**
     - Check common output directories: `build`, `dist`, `out`, `public`, `.next`
     - **Check .gitignore in migration folder** for build output patterns
     - Look in build logs for "writing output to..." messages
     - Update output_dir and redeploy

   **For "module not found" or dependency errors:**
   - **Check migration folder for lockfile** (package-lock.json or yarn.lock)
   - **Automatic fix options:**
     - If lockfile is in a subdirectory, update source_dir
     - If using private packages, check if registry auth env vars are needed
     - Add NODE_ENV=production if missing

   **For port/health check failures (service starts but fails health check):**
   - Fetch runtime logs to see what port the app is listening on
   - **Automatic fix:**
     - Check if app is hardcoded to wrong port
     - Ensure PORT environment variable is set
     - Update HTTP port configuration if needed

   **For monorepo/source directory errors:**
   - **Automatic fix:**
     - Check Vercel config for rootDirectory
     - **Search migration folder** for package.json in subdirectories
     - Look for workspace configuration files (lerna.json, nx.json, etc.)
     - Update source_dir to correct path and redeploy
     - Deploy the mono repo under 1 app, where each repository service is a `service component` or `static site component` depending on the repository service. Ask the user for confirmation.

4. **Apply the fix and redeploy:**
   - Use DigitalOcean MCP to update the app configuration
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Wait for deployment to complete and check status again

5. **Retry logic:**
   - If first automatic fix fails, fetch logs again and try alternative fix
   - Maximum 3 automatic retry attempts per app
   - After 3 failed attempts, report to user with detailed error and ask for manual intervention

6. **Report fix applied:**
   - Tell the user what error was found
   - Tell the user what fix was applied
   - Show the updated configuration

### Step 3: Validation and Automatic Recovery

After migrating the app:

1. **Verify deployment succeeded** in App Platform (use DigitalOcean MCP to check status)
   - Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take several minutes)
   - Check deployment status: should be "ACTIVE" or "DEPLOYED"

2. **If deployment FAILED, trigger automatic troubleshooting:**
   - Follow the process in section 2.8 "Automatic Deployment Troubleshooting"
   - Fetch logs, analyze errors, apply fixes automatically
   - Retry up to 3 times with different fixes
   - **Continue with validation after:**
     - The app is successfully deployed, OR
     - 3 automatic fix attempts have failed and user intervention is needed

3. **If automatic fixes fail after 3 attempts:**
   - Present detailed error information to the user
   - Show what fixes were attempted
   - Ask user for manual configuration input:
     - Correct build command
     - Correct output directory
     - Missing environment variables
     - Source directory path
   - Apply user's corrections and redeploy

4. **Test the deployed application:**
   - Visit the App Platform URL
   - Test critical functionality
   - Test API endpoints if present
   - Check that environment variables are working

5. **Report status to the user:**
   - Indicate the migration result: Success, Auto-Fixed, or Failed
   - If auto-fixed, show what was corrected
   - If failed, show the errors and fixes that were attempted

### Step 4: Migration Summary

After completing the migration, provide:

1. **Summary table** with:
   - Original Vercel app name
   - New App Platform app name
   - Status (Success/Auto-Fixed/Failed)
   - If Auto-Fixed: what error was found and what fix was applied
   - App Platform URL
   - Domains that need DNS updates (with status: pending/completed)
   - Any manual steps required

2. **Auto-fix summary** (if automatic fixes were applied):
   - Detail the errors encountered
   - Show the fixes that were successfully applied
   - Highlight any configuration changes made

3. **Domain migration checklist:**
   - List all domains that need DNS updates
   - Provide the specific DNS changes for each domain
   - Remind user to test first, then update DNS
   - Warn about DNS propagation time (up to 48 hours)

3. **Feature gaps to address:**
   - List any Vercel features that couldn't be directly migrated
   - Provide workarounds or alternative solutions

4. **Next steps:**
   - DNS update instructions (with specific records for each domain)
   - Testing recommendations
   - Optimization suggestions
   - Timeline: Remind user to keep Vercel running until DNS fully propagates

## Special Considerations

### Preview Deployments
- Vercel automatic PR previews are NOT currently available in App Platform
- **Workaround:** Create a separate dev app with dev environment
- Recommend using GitHub Actions for preview deployments

### MCP vs CLI Usage
This migration uses a **hybrid approach** combining both MCP servers and CLI tools:

**Vercel:**
- **Vercel CLI (Required):** Environment variables retrieval, app inspection
- **Vercel MCP server (Optional):** Project metadata where available
- **Note:** The Vercel MCP server does NOT provide environment variables

**DigitalOcean:**
- **DigitalOcean MCP server (Primary):** App creation, deployment management, domain configuration
- **Fallback:** `doctl` CLI or REST API if MCP is unavailable

### Database Migration
- Creating new databases is straightforward
- **Data migration** is complex and requires separate tooling
- Inform user they need to handle data migration separately

### Webhooks
- Vercel deployment webhooks exist
- App Platform webhooks are available but may be limited
- Check if webhooks are needed and configure accordingly

## Error Handling

If migration fails for an app:

1. **Capture the error details** from App Platform (via DigitalOcean MCP or dashboard)
2. **Analyze common issues:**

### Build Command Errors
**Symptom:** Build fails with "command not found" or "script not found"
**Cause:** Custom build command doesn't exist or buildpack couldn't auto-detect
**Fix:**
- **Prefer buildpack auto-detection:** Leave build command empty and let buildpack detect framework
- **If auto-detection fails:**
  - Check vercel.json for custom buildCommand
  - Read package.json from migration folder at `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/package.json`
  - Verify the framework is in dependencies (e.g., "next", "react", "vue")
  - For monorepos: ensure source_dir is correct
- **Reference:** [App Platform Node.js buildpack docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/buildpacks/nodejs/) for auto-detection behavior

### Output Directory Errors (Static Sites)
**Symptom:** "Output directory not found" or "No files to deploy"
**Cause:** The output_dir doesn't match what the build produces
**Fix:**
- Check framework documentation to find correct output directory
- **Look in .gitignore in the migration folder** - often lists build output directories
- Run the build command locally or check framework docs
- Common output directories:
  - `build` (Create React App, Vite)
  - `dist` (Vue CLI, Vite, Angular)
  - `out` (Next.js static export)
  - `public` (Gatsby, Hugo)
  - `_site` (Jekyll)
- **Inspect the migration folder** after build to see where files are output

### Run Command Errors (Web Services)
**Symptom:** Service crashes immediately or "command not found"
**Cause:** Custom run command is invalid or buildpack couldn't auto-detect
**Fix:**
- **Prefer buildpack auto-detection:** Leave run command empty and let buildpack detect framework
- **Buildpack will automatically use:**
  - Framework-specific start commands (e.g., `next start` for Next.js)
  - The "start" script from package.json if it exists
  - The "main" field from package.json for plain Node.js apps
- **If auto-detection fails:**
  - Check vercel.json for custom start command
  - Verify app is built before starting (some frameworks need build step)
  - Ensure app listens on `process.env.PORT`
- **Reference:** [App Platform Node.js buildpack docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/buildpacks/nodejs/) for default run behavior

### Port Configuration Errors
**Symptom:** Service is "unhealthy" or "failed health check"
**Cause:** App is not listening on the PORT environment variable
**Fix:**
- Ensure the app code listens on `process.env.PORT`
- Update app code if it's hardcoded to a specific port
- Default ports to check: 3000, 8080, 5000, 4000

### Monorepo/Source Directory Errors
**Symptom:** "package.json not found" or "Cannot find module"
**Cause:** The source_dir is incorrect or not set
**Fix:**
- Check Vercel's `rootDirectory` setting
- **Inspect the migration folder** at `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/`
- Look for workspace configuration in the repo (lerna.json, nx.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- Find where package.json exists in the repo structure
- Set source_dir to the path of the specific app (e.g., `apps/web`, `packages/api`)
- Ensure package.json exists at that path in the migration folder

### Missing Environment Variables
**Symptom:** Build succeeds but app crashes at runtime, or shows errors about missing config
**Cause:** Required environment variables weren't migrated
**Fix:**
- **Check .env.example or .env.sample in the migration folder** at `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/`
- Check the app's documentation (README.md in cloned repo)
- Look for required variables in the code
- Add missing variables to App Platform
- Common missing vars: DATABASE_URL, API_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_*, etc.

### Dependency Installation Errors
**Symptom:** "Cannot find module" or "npm install failed"
**Cause:** Missing dependencies, lockfile issues, or version conflicts
**Fix:**
- **Check migration folder** at `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/` for package-lock.json or yarn.lock
- Ensure lockfile is in the correct directory (root or source_dir)
- Check package.json for "engines" requirements
- Verify Node.js version compatibility (reference App Platform buildpack docs)
- May need to add environment variables for private npm registries
- If using workspaces (monorepo), ensure workspace configuration is correct

3. **Suggest fixes** based on error type
4. **Ask user** if they want to retry with corrections
5. **Update the app configuration** and redeploy

## User Communication

Throughout the migration:
- **Be transparent** about what features can and cannot be migrated
- **Warn early** about features requiring code changes (middleware, edge functions)
- **Provide alternatives** for unsupported features
- **Estimate timeframes** - typical migration should complete in under 30 minutes per app
- **Explain the process:**
  - Migration folders will be created at `./vercel-migration/<app-name>-migration/` for each app
  - App specs will be saved for each app as backup
  - App Platform buildpack documentation will be referenced for best practices
- **Explain automatic recovery** - let users know that if deployments fail, you will automatically analyze logs and attempt fixes
- **Show your work** - when automatic fixes are applied, explain what error was found and how it was fixed
- **Confirm** before making changes that could affect production
- **Keep user informed** during automatic retry attempts (e.g., "Deployment failed, analyzing logs and attempting fix 1 of 3...")
